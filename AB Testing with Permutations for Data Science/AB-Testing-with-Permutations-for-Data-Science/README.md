# A/B Testing with Permutations for Data Science

This webinar was originally developed by Carlos Afonso, who presented it on September 10, 2020 ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBy7vxtifcs)).

**Important:** As of September 10, 2021, the webinar [A/B Testing with Python and R](../AB-Testing-with-Python-and-R/) is a better/newer version of this "A/B Testing with Permutations for Data Science" webinar. One of the main differences is that this webinar uses only R while the newer version uses both Python and R.
