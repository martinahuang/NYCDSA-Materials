## Important Notes for Instructor

Things to do before presenting this webinar:

* Update at least the title cell in the Jupyter Notebook (`Matrix-Multiplication-and-Neural-Networks.ipynb`) with your name and presentation date.
* And you can make any other changes/updates you may find useful.
* Once you have the final version of the Jupyter Notebook make sure to save an HTML version of it (`Matrix-Multiplication-and-Neural-Networks.html`), which is useful to share with the participants after the webinar (as an easy option to see the webinar contents).

Presentation file to use during webinar:

* Use the Jupyter Notebook (`Matrix-Multiplication-and-Neural-Networks.ipynb`) so that you can run the code live.

The following files should **NOT** be shared with webinar participants:

* `README.md`

After the webinar presentation, you can/should put the following files in a compressed (ZIP) folder and share it with the webinar attendees:

* `Matrix-Multiplication-and-Neural-Networks.html`
* `Matrix-Multiplication-and-Neural-Networks.ipynb`
* `neural-net.svg`
